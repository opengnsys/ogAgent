class ServerWorker(object):

    A ServerWorker is a server module that "works" for service
    Most method are invoked inside their own thread, except onActivation & onDeactivation. 
    This two methods are invoked inside main service thread, take that into account when creating them
    
    * You must provide a module name (override name on your class), so we can identify the module by a "valid" name.
      A valid name is like a valid python variable (do not use spaces, etc...)
    * The name of the module is used as REST message destination id:
      https://sampleserver:8888/[name]/....
      Remember that module names and REST path are case sensitive!!!

        implement a method that is called exactly as "process_" + path[0] (module name has been removed from path array) and this default processMessage will invoke it
        * Example:
            Imagine this invocation url (no matter if GET or POST): http://example.com:9999/Sample/mazinger/Z
            The HTTP Server will remove "Sample" from path, parse arguments and invoke this method as this:
            module.processMessage(["mazinger","Z"], getParams, postParams)
            
            This method will process "mazinguer", and look for a "self" method that is called "process_mazinger", and invoke it this way:

            In the case path is empty (that is, the path is composed only by the module name, like in "http://example.com/Sample", the "process" method
            will be invoked directly
