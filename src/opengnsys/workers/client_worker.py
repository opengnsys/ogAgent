class ClientWorker(object):
    '''
    A ServerWorker is a server module that "works" for service
    Most method are invoked inside their own thread, except onActivation & onDeactivation. 
    This two methods are invoked inside main service thread, take that into account when creating them
    
    * You must provide a module name (override name on your class), so we can identify the module by a "valid" name.
      A valid name is like a valid python variable (do not use spaces, etc...)
    * The name of the module is used as REST message destination id:
      https://sampleserver:8888/[name]/....
      Remember that module names and REST path are case sensitive!!!

        This method can be overriden to provide your own message proccessor, or better you can
        implement a method that is called "process_" + message and this default processMessage will invoke it
        * Example:
            We got a message from OGAgent "Mazinger", with json params
            module.processMessage("mazinger", jsonParams)
            
            This method will process "mazinguer", and look for a "self" method that is called "process_mazinger", and invoke it this way:
               return self.process_mazinger(jsonParams)
               
            The methods must return data that can be serialized to json (i.e. Ojects are not serializable to json, basic type are)

        This MUST be overridden by modules!
        This method is invoked inside main thread, so if it "hangs", complete service will hang
        This should be no problem, but be advised about this
